                    <p>The INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, said, “When the commission introduced BVAS last year, the compact device was intended to achieve two objectives. First is the verification of the genuineness of the PVC and the fingerprint or facial authentication of voters during accreditation. Secondly, to replace the Z-pad for uploading the polling unit results to the INEC Result Viewing Portal (IReV) in real-time on election day.”
                        BVAS also acts as the INEC Voter Enrollment Device (IVED) during voter registration. Its usage has also eliminated the use of incident forms during accreditation on an election day, from the situation room of the recently concluded Osun state gubernatorial election that INEC’s accreditation system, BVAS, performed better as there just reports of BVAS failing to authenticate voters by fingerprints and facials at most of the polling units while also there was no reported incident of low battery or malfunctioning of the BVAS in the polling units.
                        Nonetheless, there were cases of failed fingerprints and malfunctioning of the devices in a few locations.

                    <p>INEC is also responsible for monitoring political campaigns and providing rules and regulations which shall govern the political parties, conduct voter and civic education and promote knowledge of sound democratic election process.
                        Over time, the commission has expressed readiness to apply the provisions of the new electoral law in its resolve to conduct the 2023 general elections without fear or favour and ensure free, fair, credible, inclusive, and transparent elections come February thereby enriching Nigeria’s democratic culture and acceptable election outcomes.
                        The changes made in the newly signed Electoral Act has introduced some interesting changes, some of which are the conduct of early party primaries by political parties; technological changes in the electoral process; extension of time frame for campaigns by political parties; provision for central electronic voters’ database; revision of definition of over-voting; exclusion of political appointees from acting as voting delegates or aspirants; death of electoral candidates and technological adoption in electoral acts.
                        Under the new act, there is provision for the use of electronic devices such as smartcard readers, electronic voting machines and other technological devices in the accreditation process for voters and the general conduct of elections.

                    <p>During the 2023 general elections, voters are expected to go to polling units to elect the president, governors, as well as federal and state legislators.
                        The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said that elections for these offices are scheduled to hold in two phases, beginning with the presidency and National Assembly on Saturday, February 25, 2023, and then governorship and Houses of Assembly on Saturday, March 11, 2023.
                        Established by the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, some of the functions of INEC are to organise, undertake and supervise all elections to the offices of the president and vice president, governors and deputy governors, members of the senate, House of Representatives and House of Assembly.

                    <p>However, one of the new innovations in the Electoral Act is the deployment of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS).
                        The 2023 elections will rely on the deployment of technologies such as BVAS, INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED), INEC Result Viewing Portal (IRev) and other devices.
